# Windows LAN File Share Utility Requirements
# No external dependencies required - uses only Python standard library
# Compatible with Python 3.6+

# The application uses only built-in Python modules:
# - tkinter (GUI framework - comes with Python)
# - http.server (HTTP server)
# - socket (network operations)
# - threading (concurrent operations)
# - pathlib (file path handling)
# - subprocess (system operations)
# - webbrowser (browser integration)
# - json (data serialization)
# - uuid (unique identifiers)
# - datetime (date/time operations)
# - os (operating system interface)

# Note: tkinter is included with most Python installations on Windows.
# If tkinter is not available, install it with:
# python -m pip install tk

# For enhanced features (optional):
# requests>=2.25.0  # For better HTTP client functionality
# pillow>=8.0.0     # For image thumbnail generation
# psutil>=5.8.0     # For system information and network scanning
